## About the website

**La Rinascente** is a premier Italian retail chain specializing in clothing, cosmetics, accessories, and housewares. According to its [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rinascente) page, the company was first established in Milan in 1865 by Luigi and Ferdinando Bocconi. It held an illustrious national presence, especially in the 20th century when it became a beacon for Italian design and fashion. Notably, iconic graphic designer Max Huber worked for the company producing impactful marketing campaigns and reinventing its image. Italian patriarch senator Borletti acquired the major stake in La Rinascente in 1917 and in 2011, it was sold to Central Group, a Thailand-based retail corporation. The company is not publicly listed thus there are no details regarding stock market, symbol, IPO date or market cap. 

Key competitors in the Italian retail market include **Coin**, [OVS](https://www.ovs.it/), **Zara** and **H&M**. [Coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_(department_store)), founded in 1926, began as a small haberdashery in Venice and gradually expanded throughout Italy.
